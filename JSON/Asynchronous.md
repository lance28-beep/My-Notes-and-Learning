## Asynchronous Code

Lesson Overview

- Explain what a callback is
- Explain what a promise is
- Explain the circumstances under which promises are better than callbacks
- Explain what the .then() function does

Callbacks

- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. MDN.
- Callbacks are functions that are executed asynchronously, or at a later time.
- Instead of the code reading top to bottom procedurally, async programs may execute different functions at different times based on the order and the speed that earlier functions like http requests or file system reads happen.

## Promises

- Convert Callbacks to promisses
- how to create Promisses
- how to use Promisses
- Why
- Different phases of Promises
- Error handling
- Chain multiple Promises

reminder:
Synchronous - code blocks the execution of any line that comes after
Asynchronous - code does not if i have two functions here that take five seconds to complete one synchronous and
