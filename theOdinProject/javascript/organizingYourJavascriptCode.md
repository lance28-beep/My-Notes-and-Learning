Object literal

```
const myObject = {
  property: 'Value!',
  otherProperty: 77,
  "obnoxious property": function(){
    return "alert"
  }
}
```

2 ways to get information out of an object

```
// dot notation
myObject.property // 'Value!'

// bracket notation
myObject["obnoxious property"] // [Function]

```

Object as a Design pattern.
simplest ways you can begin to organize your code is by simply grouping things into objects

Object Constructors

// prototype is just a shared object.

// Factory Functions And The Module Pattern
Factory functions - simply set up and return the new object when you call the function.

// Scope and Closure
Scope - is the term that refers to where things like variables and functions can be used in your code.

---

Scope - variable access
The concept of closure is the idea that functions retain their scope even if they are passed around and called outside of that scope
Context - this

//Private Variables and Functions

Factories are simply plain old JavaScript functions that return objects for us to use in our code.
Using factories is a powerful way to organize and contain the code you’re writing

Inheritance with factories

The Module Pattern
Modules are actually very similar to factory functions. The main difference is how they’re created.
The concepts are exactly the same as the factory function. However, instead of creating a factory that we can use over and over again to create multiple objects, the module pattern wraps the factory in an 
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
<code>;(() => console.log('hello world'))()</code>
